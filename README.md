# Script-seismic_event_classification
Script for Classification of Glacial Seismic Events using Machine Learning

For the Feature Plots, assign class names manually in a column named class_names before running this. The file used is called features_labeled.csv.

For the Trained Random Forest on a new dataset, note that the dataset mustn't have class names. The file used is called 2025_features.csv.
